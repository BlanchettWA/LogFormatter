# LogFormatter

## Version History

Jan 30, 2018: Initial version. Written entirely through vim!

## How to use
1. Run through python 3.

On linux, this is ``python3 formatter.py`` 
The steps are similar on Windows and Mac, but more detailed instructions soon 

2. Follow the instructions: Type the source filename, then the new filename. The extension must be included in both. The input file must also be in the same directory.
