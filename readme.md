# LogFormatter

*A quick project to experiment with python input/outputs, while also reformatting Telegram logs to be more streamline* 

## Version History

Jan 30, 2018: Initial version. Written entirely through vim! 

## Requirements
* Python

## How to use
1. Run through python

On linux, this is ``python3 formatter.py`` 

On Windows, 
* Open through IDLE 

OR 

* [Add python to the path](https://superuser.com/questions/143119/how-do-i-add-python-to-the-windows-path), then run with ``python formatter.py``

Mac is similiar to Linux I believe, feel free to test and correct.  

2. Follow the instructions: Type the source filename, then the new filename. The extension must be included in both. The input file must also be in the same directory, and the names MUST be typed in quotes.  

## Known Issues
> Cannot handle complex Telegram messages (Replies, Fowards, Images, etc. )

> Not user friendly 










*Inspired by a friend. Feel free to use and fork and do whatever with*
